# sparseWeightBasedPCA: Regularized weight based Simultaneous Component Analysis (SCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
An R package for regularized weight based SCA and PCA 

## Description
`sparseWeightBasedPCA` Provides functions for the estimation of sparse SCA and PCA with sparse component weights.
    The functions are based on alternating least-squares algorithms that alternate between the estimation of the loadings and weights.
    Also model selection tools are provided to select the meta-parameters of the provided functions.
    Check the ```vignettes``` and package documentation for further details.
